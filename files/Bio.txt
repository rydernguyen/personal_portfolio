I was born in Vietnam and have been living in the United States for more than 10 years. My experience started out with being an exchange student in Granbury, Texas. Since then, I’ve been to schools in three different states and have had more than three years of work experience in the financial industry. Graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Actuarial Science, I am currently located in San Francisco pursuing a Master’s degree in Business Analytics.
I am a self-identified creative mind trapped inside a mathematical brain. I have a fascination with numbers and computer programs and enthralled by the power of big data. To keep myself from going haywire, I find my refuge in my creative side from time to time. My artistic adventures include singing in choruses (Boston Gay Men's chorus and San Francisco Gay Men’s chorus), pencil sketching, acting in plays and musicals, and most of all, baking to satisfy his sweet tooth.
