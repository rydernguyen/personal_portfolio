Primary risk is caused by liquefaction. Most susceptible soil type D per Geological Survey classification is prevalent in Back Bay. Due to the earth shaking, water pressure increases in saturated soil. Once the water pressure increases, soil particles can readily move with respect to each other.
Buildings in Back Bay make up a total dollar exposure of about 9.9 billion. Wood and masonry buildings are most at risk with the latter incurring the most direct economic loss of 12.5 million dollars.
