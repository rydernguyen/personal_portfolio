It is important for homeowners, business owners, landlords, institutions and insurance companies in the Back Bay area to have a quantifiable measurement of the earthquake risk they partake. Understanding the economic and social impacts caused by an earthquake will be crucial in preemptive planning for future catastrophes. Most importantly, the great potential loss by buildings urges urban planners, the authority and engineers to strive for more stable structure and designs that could greatly decrease the amount of dollar loss. Though the risk posed by liquefaction is almost unavoidable since the whole of Back Bay is already developed and buildings are closely located, there are techniques mentioned that should be implemented in newly developed areas. Though the risk is small, companies and the government should bear watch and update the estimated cost often. They also need to require stricter building standards that would make the buildings withstand the impact of earthquakes.
