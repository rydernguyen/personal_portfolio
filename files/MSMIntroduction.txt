I was originally interested in this project because of my curiosity for financial markets. As part of my business education at Bentley University, I learned about some financial models. However, they all seem too na√Øve and simple and always come with lots of uncertainties and limitations. Therefore, for my senior capstone project, I decided to look into fractals and their applications in modeling time series.
In the simplest terms, fractal is a self-similar pattern on every scale. They are structures that exist in nature where the whole is comprised of the smaller components that resemble the whole. They are in the tree branches where a big tree branch is made out of similar smaller branches. They are in a human body (in the branch-like linings of the lung, of the heart). They can exist in small things like the spiraling pattern of a seashell or big things like the galaxy. In math terms, fractals are created by simple equations or repeated procedures to get to the final product.
