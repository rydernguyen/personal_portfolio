When I was finishing my liberal studies in Earth, Environment & Global Sustainability, I was looking for a project that would combine both my analytical skills and my interest in environmental sustainability. From a course about the history of Boston, I learned that part of Boston was land-filled by carving down nearby mountains. I then became interested in looking at the risks associated with a possible catastrophe.
Exploring my options, I decided to estimate the financial risk after an earthquake in Back Bay, Boston which was almost entirely filled in. Though the risk of earthquake is not as prevalent on the east coast compared to the west coast, buildings were built without a potential earthquake in mind. I used San Francisco as my point of comparison since the city by the bay was also built on a substantial amount of landfill and have experienced many earthquakes in the past.
I used a program called HAZUS developed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in order to estimate the loss exposure posed by vulnerable infrastructure. Certain assumptions and point of comparison were made including: Cape Ann earthquake happened in 1755, proportions of commercial vs residential buildings, value of assets at risk.
